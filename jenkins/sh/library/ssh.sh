    #
    # We inject the pv(1) (pipe viewer) utility in between the stream so
    # we can output statistics about the speed of the transfer.
    #
    # pv(1) will print carriage returns instead of newline characters
    # each time it updates the statistics it's showing, so that it can
    # continually update the output inline (instead of printing a new
    # line for each update) when it is run interactively from the
    # command line.
    #
    # Unfortunately, Jenkins does not handle carriage returns the same
    # way it does new lines, and the "console" page for a job will only
    # be updated when a newline is printed. Thus, as pv(1) prints its
    # updates, these will not get propagated to the job's "console" page
    # until the transfer completes and a new line is printed. This
    # essentially defeats the purpose of using pv(1) at all, since the
    # point is to periodically display output as feedback to let the user
    # know the transfer is progressing.
    #
    # To work around this limitation, we pipe the output from pv(1) into
    # tr(1) and replace any carriage returns with newlines; this will
    # achieve the desired behavior with each update from pv(1) being
    # immediately displayed on a new line in the Jenkins job's "console"
    # page.
    #
    # Additionally, we need to use stdbuf(1) to prevent bash from
    # buffering the output of pv(1). If we did not use stdbuf(1), the
    # output emitted by pv(1) wouldn't get immediately printed to the
    # Jenkins job's "console" page; instead, multiple lines would get
    # batched and all printed to the "console" page at the same time.
    # Again, this would defeat the purpose of using pv(1) at all, since
    # we really want to have each line that is emitted, shown on the
    # job's "console" page immeidately.
    #
    # Lastly, we want to stream the contents of the compressed tarball
    # (which reflects the contents of the remote directory) to stdout,
    # so we must perform a complicated dance of Bash redirection to
    # ensure *only* the contents of the tarball will be redirected to
    # stdout, and *everything else* (i.e. the progress reporting emitted
    # by pv(1)) is contained in stderr. Ultimately, this complexity
    # stems from the fact that we have to pipe the output of pv(1)
    # through stdbuf(1) and tr(1) (as described above).
